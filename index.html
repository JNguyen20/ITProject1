  <p>
    Hello! My name is Jarrod Nguyen, a 24 year-old student currently studying Information Technology at RMIT university.
    My student number is 		s3934886 and student email is s3934886@student.rmit.edu.au.
    I just started the course in November of 2021, after transferring from an Engineering course that I previously wasn’t enjoying all that much.
    I’m hoping that by undergoing an I.T. course, I will be able to find my passion and pursue a career in the industry.
    <br><br>
    I am Vietnamese by ethnicity, but I was born and raised in Australia, specifically in Melbourne. Despite this, unfortunately I can only speak English.
    <br><br>
    Recently, a hobby I’ve picked up is coffee, both the brewing of coffee and the latte art. While I’m still quite bad at it,
    I find the process of learning how to make and improve my espresso fun and satisfying.
    My current goal with my hobby is to eventually be able to identify and taste the nuances of different coffees, as well as progress in being able to pour more complex latte arts.
    <br><br>
    All my life, I’ve loved video games and that has still carried on till today. I’m addicted to the competitiveness that comes with the multiplayer aspect of games, but also the social aspect.
    I love being able to meet and befriend people in different states or even across the world alongside competing with and against others.
    <br><br>
    This love for gaming was also what sparked my interest in IT. An interest in video games naturally progressed to an interest in computers and technology in general.
    Seeing the technological advancements surrounding my interest in games such as computer components, panel technology or machine learning upscaling always fascinated me.
    This fascination is what guided me towards studying IT.
    <br><br>
    The only IT experience I have so far is studying an IT subject in high school and basic coding units in my previous course in engineering.
    I’m hoping to use this IT course to both broaden and deepen my knowledge to help me pursue a career in IT.
    <br><br>
    I chose RMIT to assist me in this pursuit, mostly because they allowed me to study online off premise.
    Having this flexibility was of great importance to me, especially during these tough times.
    From RMIT, I’m hoping to be able to experience a little bit of the many specialisations that make up the IT industry.
    From there, maybe find one that truly interests me where I can make it my goal to find a job in that field.
  </p>

  <h2 id="ideal_job">Ideal Job</h2>
  <p>
    If I had to choose a dream job in the present, I would have to go with a software engineering role at a popular video game company like Valve.
    <br><br>

    <figure>
      <img src = "valve_job_ad.png" alt = "Valve Corporation" align = "middle" style = "width: 60%; margin: 10px; padding-left: 50px;">
      <figcaption style = "padding-left: 60px">Ad for game development software engineer at Valve Corporation</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <br>
    A job at Valve would fall in line with my interest in video games.
    Valve specifically develops games that I really enjoy in Counter-Strike Global Offensive and Dota 2.
    They are also one of the industry leaders in both the video game and e-sports department so a job at Valve.
    Although a job at Valve would probably be very challenging, I would also find great satisfaction working on and developing the specific games I love playing, while also accumulating experience at a prestigious company.
    <br><br>
    The qualification required to apply for the position of a software engineer at Valve entails programming experience in C++ or a similar language, along with at least four years of professional experience in software development.
    They don’t require an actual degree, but instead look for those with experience and strong software engineering skills.
    Employees at Valve are also known to have a lot of freedom, being able to pick and choose the projects they would like to work on.
    Due to this, you need to display the ability to self-direct work to completion, on top of having strong communication skills and the ability to work with teams.
    <br><br>
    Unfortunately in the present, I wouldn’t qualify for a position at Valve.
    I have very little to no knowledge in any programming language nor possess any software engineering skills.
     While I believe I would be capable in working well in a team, I have no experience in what those responsibilities entail within a company or working environment.
    <br><br>
    To obtain the qualifications and skills required for this position, I would use this IT course to learn the fundamental IT skills such as programming,
    learning to work in a team for specific projects and general skills useful in the industry.
    From there, getting any post graduate job that involves programming would allow me to accumulate experience as both a programmer and understanding how communication and
    teamwork relative to the IT field. If the position allows it, perhaps I could create a sort of portfolio of completed projects to demonstrate that I have the means to drive work to completion.

    These are the results of my Myers-Briggs test, learning style test and big five personality test:
    <br>

<div class = "row">
       <div class = "column">
           <img src ="myersbriggs.png" alt = "myers briggs test" style = "width:100%">
           <figcaption>Myers-Briggs test results</figcaption>
       </div>

       <div class = "column">
           <img src ="learningstyle.png" alt = "learning styles test" style = "width:100%">

           <figcaption>Big five personality test results</figcaption>
       </div>
   </div>

    <br>
    These tests suggest that I’m a visual learner with a more introverted and observant personality.
    I’m private and reserved, which makes it harder to get to know me.
    I tend to be more logical in the way I think.
    I excel when it comes to the more practical, hands on aspects, but struggle with moments that require a more abstract, creative or imaginative way of thinking.
    I tend to get distracted easily but have the capability of focusing and releasing all my energy when push comes to shove.
    I’m not naturally empathetic or emotional, but I like to avoid hostility and competitiveness within the group.
    <br><br>
    Taking these behavioural traits into account in a team environment, my introverted nature may make interpersonal relationships a little more difficult and in extension, communication within the group.
    Being more logical and practical, clear instructions and guidance would be beneficial for productivity.
    I’d also be willing to put the team first to avoid conflicts or issues from arising.
    Thus, when forming a team it would be important to balance my pros and cons among the other members.
    Ideally, a priority would be individuals who are willing to take leadership with good communication and organisation skills.
    Also someone with a more abstract personality that can make up for my lack of creativity and imagination.

  <h2 id="project_idea">Project Idea</h2>

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    My project idea incorporates augmented reality (AR) technology with tabletop games in order to redefine and enhance the gameplay experience of how board games are played.
    Imagine having a digital library of a multitude of board games, all contained within a single play zone that changes depending on the game.
    Users would be able to interact directly with the augmented reality system to interact with the board or pieces to progress their game.
    It would also include a play store of sorts where users can purchase different board games or maybe even a subscription-based service that allows access to every game within the store.
  </p>

  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>
    Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality technology within the video game industry is a rapidly growing market.
    Statista (2020) claims that the virtual reality annual global revenue from gaming in 2017 was roughly 400 million U.S. dollars.
    It grew to 800 million U.S. dollars in 2019, and is now forecasted to grow an additional 300% and reach 2.4 billion U.S. dollars in annual global revenue by 2024.
    <br><br>
    With a growing market for these devices in home use, there will also be a growing demand for a larger list of compatible video games and further innovation to the technology.
    The field is in its infancy and is ripe for opportunities to penetrate into the market.

  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    This project would have the ability to contain multiple board games within one system.
    It could make use of one general board on a table, and the use of augmented reality (AR) glasses.
    Through the glasses, it would dynamically change the playing board, depending on the game and the users would be able to play and interact with the game through the projections.
    This would allow a multitude of board games to be played without the need of any set up or any physical objects the game would otherwise require.
    In conjunction with the ability to have a digital library of games available to the user, it can create a much more efficient experience space wise, compared to their physical counterparts.
    It would also allow for games to enhance the user experience.
    They can become more immersive, using the AR technology to animate the game.
    Now the background scenes can be painted, or animations that correspond to the user’s action can be shown.
    It has the ability to create a more intimate, personal game for the players.
    <br><br>
    To interact with the AR system, a controller, that could be similar to current VR controllers, would be used.
    The controller is tracked by the camera and in conjunction with physical button presses, it would be how the player rolls the dice, moves their pieces and in general, interact with the board.
    The board itself would use a physical board, that the AR system would use as a reference point to track and contain all assets the game would need.
    <br><br>
    Physical board games rely on the user’s imagination if they want to create a setting or play out a scene.
    An AR system could allow games to tie animations to specific moves or choices made in the game.
    For example, in a roleplaying game, defeating your opponent could play an animation relative to the method used to defeat them.
    In addition to this, it could be used to create a dynamic setting.
    Board games could use this to enhance the aesthetic of the board, or roleplaying games could project a background or scenes relating to the setting of the game.
    It creates a much more immersive experience for the players.
    <br><br>
    Another possible feature is the ability to save and resume the state of the game.
    Although this is also possible in a physical rendition of any game, this would eliminate the need for packing and setting up, as well as the requirement to physically memorise the state of the game.
    It is a more efficient, user-friendly approach where there is very little room for error.
    <br><br>
    A play store could be implemented to both facilitate the purchasing and organisation of a list of compatible games that the user owns.
    This allows individuals to easily browse through a multitude of games that they may find interesting as well as serve as a launcher for said games.
    A subscription service could also be launched with a high enough quantity of games available.
    The user would pay an annual fee and be granted access to every game in the library for no additional cost.
    Players would be able to try different games they may have been hesitant about, without committing the whole cost if they were to dislike it.
  </p>

  <h3>Tools and Technology</h3>
  <p>
    Firstly, this project idea requires a device that is compatible with augmented reality technology.
    It could make use of pre-existing AR devices, such as the Oculus Quest 2, the Merge AR/VR headset, Microsoft HoloLens 2, the Magic Leap One, or many more.
    These devices may be limited by their components, tracking or user interface.
    A separate device may need to be designed if they are incompatible with the project.
    <br><br>
    To design and create the games, an engine compatible with VR and AR is required.
    The two most popular options, as stated by Zareba (2021), are Unreal Engine and Unity.
    The choice would be up to the developer.
    Unreal Engine offers much better graphical performance, while Unity is more versatile and easier to integrate into VR and AR.
  </p>

  <h3>Skills Required</h3>
  <p>
    As stated by Sharma (2019) some of the skills required for development within AR and VR are knowledge of hardware specifications and how they operate, 3D modelling, computer-aided design(CAD), sound design and software engineering, just to name a few.
    <br><br>
    The developer needs to know how the AR devices work in conjunction with the relevant programming languages and skills in order to implement them into their engine of choice.
    If the developer chose Unity or Unreal Engine, then proficiency in C# or C++ respectively, would be required.
    Knowledge of 3D modelling, CAD and 3D animation would be required if the developer wished to create their own game assets.
    Sound design would also be useful for integrating audio into the game, which could be in the form of background music or effects.
  </p>

  <h3>Outcome</h3>
  <p>
    The goal for any game is to entertain the users playing it.
    If the project is successful, it will offer a unique way to enhance the gameplay experience of tabletop games.
    It creates an alternative way to enjoy board games and could open up more possibilities for the genre.
    <br><br>
    The underlying technology could also be used as a foundation for innovation.
    Future improvements to both the hardware and software could result in a much better user experience.
    It could also offer additional variables for developers to work with, which would create the opportunity for more unique and creative video games.
